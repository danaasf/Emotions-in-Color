1
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,166
Captain!

2
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,416
Captain!

3
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,583
Can we talk?

4
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,500
Hmm.

5
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,291
We must break through the ice.

6
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,416
The men are hungry
and exhausted.

7
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,750
We cannot keep up this pace
without consequence.

8
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,875
Listen up, men!

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,167
The more we delay the labor,

10
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,708
the firmer the grasp
of the ice will become.

11
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,708
The work continues.

12
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,583
Rotate each group.

13
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:37,875
Sir, with respect...

14
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,000
The men need assurances.

15
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:40,917
Assurances?

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,750
Yes, that we will head back
to St. Petersburg once we free the ship.

17
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,542
They don't think we'll be seaworthy
for long and they want to know...

18
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,083
Listen up!

19
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:55,792
It is neither your place,
nor the officer here, to think anything...

20
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:59,250
We signed up for a mission
and we will see it to completion.

21
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,667
We will reach the North Pole.

22
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,375
Is it understood?

23
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,791
An explosion, Captain.

24
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,083
About two miles away.

25
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,083
Get the men.

26
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,916
The sled dogs are unharmed.

27
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,042
Then where does all this blood come from?

28
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,708
Over here, Captain!

29
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,167
A wounded man, he's lost a lot of blood.

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,916
Wound to the shoulder, his leg is broken.

31
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,291
Bear attack?

32
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,792
I don't think so, Captain.

33
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,708
Larsen, help me with his boot.

34
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:43,958
A prosthetic leg.

35
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,333
Put him on the board.

36
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,375
Hurry! To the ship! Now!

37
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,625
Larsen, that thing is coming.

38
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,541
Ready the rifles!

39
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,000
On my command.

40
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,125
Aim!

41
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,875
Fire!

42
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,916
Next group!

43
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,833
Fire!

44
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,375
All to the ship!!

45
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,292
Where is that man
we brought onboard?

46
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,416
Where?

47
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,500
What is that thing? What does it want?

48
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,666
Bring him to me!

49
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,667
The blunderbuss.
Larsen, get the blunderbuss!

50
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,416
Victor.

51
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,166
Victor!

52
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,791
I killed it.

53
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,708
I killed it.

54
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:36,917
It's still alive!

55
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,125
Ladder!

56
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,542
Pull up the ladder!

57
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:58,500
Bring him to me!

58
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,458
How many shots are left?

59
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,500
One, but it can't kill it.

60
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,666
I know.

61
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,875
I'm not aiming for him.

62
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,791
Laudanum,
to ease the pain. Drink it. Drink it.

63
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,458
Where am I?

64
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,250
You are on
the Royal Danish ship, Horisont.

65
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,167
I'm Captain Anderson. This is Dr. Udsen.

66
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,167
How many of your men did it kill?

67
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:34,667
Six.

68
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,208
It will come back and kill many more.

69
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:41,667
All of you, if necessary,
unless you deliver me to it.

70
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,375
No, no. It's gone.

71
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,333
It sank in the freezing waters. It's dead.

72
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,125
No, it is not!

73
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,833
It cannot die.

74
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,166
I have tried to destroy it.

75
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,416
Whether you believe me or not,

76
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,208
it will come back... for me.

77
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,125
And when it does,

78
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,583
you must promise
that you will put me out on the ice

79
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:07,916
and let it take me.

80
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,291
Please.

81
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,625
What manner
of creature is that?

82
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,875
What manner of devil made him?

83
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,041
I did.

84
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I did.

85
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,500
I made him.

86
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:32,375
I had determined that the memory
of my evils should die with me.

87
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,208
It's ready.

88
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,583
Some of what I will tell you is fact.

89
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,500
Some is not, but it is all true.

90
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,791
My name is Victor.

91
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,791
Victor Frankenstein.

92
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,000
It was my father who gave me that name.

93
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,250
Do you know what it means?

94
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,791
I believe I do, yes. Conqueror.

95
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,667
One that wins it all.

96
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,875
Yes. It all started with him.

97
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,292
My father.

98
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,333
And my mother.

99
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,166
<i>Victor!</i>

100
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,666
<i>Victor!</i>

101
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,250
Victor!

102
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:24,041
Come down,
your father is arriving.

103
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,750
<i>Maman? Maman?</i>

104
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,333
I'm here, Mother.

105
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,083
I'm here.

106
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,458
<i>My father was a baron
and a preeminent surgeon.</i>

107
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,583
<i>He had married my mother
largely out of convenience,</i>

108
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,667
<i>as her dowry was considerable
and her lineage noble.</i>

109
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:53,208
<i>It furnished my father with the means
to preserve his rank and family estate.</i>

110
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,833
<i>He was absent from our lives,</i>

111
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:11,000
<i>but when he came home,
the entire household bent to his will.</i>

112
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,666
Claire, dear.

113
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,446
<i>The rest of the time...</i>

114
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,083
Victor.

115
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,167
Father.

116
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,666
<i>The rest of the time,
Mother was mine.</i>

117
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,541
No, bring that here.

118
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,083
The salts in the meat
will enrich your blood,

119
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,541
as well as the baby's.

120
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,791
You eat for two, remember?

121
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:54,958
Go on.

122
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,125
It's nutritious.

123
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,042
<i>Guardian angel.</i>

124
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,500
Sweet companion.

125
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,416
Stand by my side and do not leave me.

126
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,375
Under your mantle,

127
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,583
shelter me, and...

128
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,625
<i>I would hear them through
the wall, arguing incessantly,</i>

129
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:22,625
<i>yelling at each other
about wealth, estate... and me.</i>

130
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,458
<i>Their voices filled me with fear.</i>

131
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,083
<i>Maman?</i>

132
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,208
<i>Maman?</i>

133
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,125
<i>The man despised us both.</i>

134
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:52,125
<i>Our raven black hair, our deep, dark eyes.</i>

135
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:56,708
<i>Even our quiet,
at times nervous disposition</i>

136
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,583
<i>seemed to exasperate him to no end.</i>

137
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,917
List as accurately as you can
the ancient classification

138
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,292
of the humors in the human body.

139
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:11,708
Blood, black bile, yellow bile,
and phlegm.

140
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,208
Average male heart. Weight?

141
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,833
Nine to eleven ounces, Father.

142
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,833
Average female heart. Weight?

143
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,416
Eight to ten ounces.

144
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,875
Why do you suppose that is?

145
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,750
Difference in mass in female heart?

146
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,666
Depth of emotion?

147
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,958
Tendency to the melancholic?

148
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,500
Mass. Volume of blood, Father.
Muscular irrigation.

149
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,250
Quite.
There is no spiritual content in tissue,

150
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,208
and no emotion in a muscle.

151
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,791
Now, describe the main function
of the tricuspid valve, please.

152
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,667
I cannot recall, Father,
but I'm sure I will remember.

153
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,250
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

154
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,917
Ivory does not bleed, Victor.

155
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,333
Flesh does.

156
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,250
By the time you remember a fact,
your patient could be dead.

157
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,791
You understand?

158
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,333
The main function of the tricuspid valve

159
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,916
is to prevent the reflux of blood
into the vena cava.

160
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,916
No, not your hands. Not anymore.

161
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,583
They are now the instruments
of your craft and will,

162
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,041
and we must care for them.

163
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,666
Your face, however, is vanity.

164
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:46,833
You bear my name, Victor,
and with it my reputation.

165
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,500
I pray you remember that.

166
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,250
I feel you have
something very good, <i>parce que...</i>

167
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:02,958
Three...

168
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,041
Two...

169
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,541
One...

170
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,708
That's impossible.

171
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,500
I'll shuffle.

172
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,458
Mother?

173
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,000
<i>Maman?</i>

174
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,875
Father!

175
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,458
Father. It's Mother.

176
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,625
<i>Maman.</i>

177
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,333
I need hot water
and clean linen. A lot of it.

178
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,250
-Now.
-Sir.

179
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,750
-No, Victor!
-Mother?

180
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,500
<i>-Maman!</i>
-Victor!

181
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,375
Father! Father!

182
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,541
-Victor!
-Save her, please!

183
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:41,125
<i>My mother, whom I had come
to consider a part of my very self,</i>

184
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,500
<i>she who I thought would never leave,</i>

185
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:49,333
<i>she who was life... was now death.</i>

186
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,833
<i>Her eyes extinguished,</i>

187
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:57,041
<i>her smile feeding the cold earth.</i>

188
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Leave!

189
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,208
All of you, leave!

190
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,958
<i>A part of the universe
had been hollowed out</i>

191
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,833
<i>and the firmament
was now permanently dark.</i>

192
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,041
<i>Now, cover your eyes.</i>

193
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,791
Don't look until I tell you to.

194
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,542
Now.

195
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,708
<i>William grew
full of sunshine and smiles.</i>

196
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:41,541
<i>He was of a calmer, gentler disposition,
clearly favored by my father.</i>

197
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,583
Thank you, Father.

198
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,416
Oh, it's a pleasure, my boy.

199
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,583
<i>He was the breeze,
I was the storm cloud.</i>

200
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,792
<i>He was all laughter, I was all frowns.</i>

201
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,333
Pick up the reins.

202
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,292
Look at me, Father.
Look at me.

203
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,000
<i>There was something more.</i>

204
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,291
<i>Or rather, something was missing.</i>

205
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,000
<i>My mother had died</i>

206
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,542
<i>at the hands of the most
distinguished doctor of his day:</i>

207
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,875
<i>My father.</i>

208
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:18,708
<i>An idea... took shape in my mind.</i>

209
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,375
Define the circulatory system,
if you will...

210
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,625
<i>Inevitable, unavoidable...</i>

211
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,125
...as enunciated
in <i>De Motu Cordis.</i>

212
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,041
<i>...until it became truth.</i>

213
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,541
Father?

214
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,875
You let her die, did you not?

215
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:41,042
I did everything in my power to save her.
You must know that.

216
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,416
So you failed.

217
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,333
-No one can conquer death.
-Mm-hmm.

218
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,541
I will. I will conquer it.

219
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,333
Everything you know, I will know.
And more.

220
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,333
I think we've done quite enough for today.

221
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,166
<i>I was born anew that night.</i>

222
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,291
I had a vision.

223
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,541
I saw, for the first time...

224
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,750
<i>the Dark Angel.</i>

225
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,416
<i>And it made me a promise.</i>

226
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,791
<i>I would have command
over the forces of life and death.</i>

227
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,167
<i>I would become every ounce
the surgeon my father was.</i>

228
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,500
<i>I would surpass him
in ambition and in reach.</i>

229
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,000
<i>The vision was so clear.</i>

230
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,291
<i>Clearer than anything I'd ever seen
in my waking hours or dreams.</i>

231
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:55,916
<i>But how?</i>

232
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,208
My downfall was swift.

233
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,875
Two revolts and a fire
on my mother's plantations

234
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,625
dwindled the family fortune.

235
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,125
We kept the estate,
but lost everything else.

236
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,500
<i>William went to one side
of the family in Vienna</i>

237
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,916
<i>and I to London, then Edinburgh.</i>

238
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:56,625
<i>And there, for decades, I tried to...</i>

239
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:02,125
expand the narrow limits of academia.

240
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,291
Life.

241
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:10,833
{\an8}This... is life, gentlemen.

242
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:13,958
We are born.

243
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,417
Hmm?

244
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,416
And no sooner do we rise, we fall.

245
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,500
Death.

246
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,833
And in the space between
that rise and fall,

247
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,750
our humble little purview.

248
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,875
Now, birth is not in our hands.

249
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Is it?

250
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:40,000
Conception, that spark,
the animation of thought and soul.

251
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,375
That is in God's hands.

252
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,167
God.

253
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,416
But death.

254
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,666
Ah, now there lies the challenge.

255
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,958
That should be our concern.

256
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,375
It <i>should</i> be.

257
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,791
Who are we to do so?
We are not gods, are we?

258
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:02,583
But if we are to behave
as immodestly as gods,

259
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,625
we must, at the very least,
deliver miracles.

260
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,250
Wouldn't you say?

261
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,292
Ignite a divine spark...

262
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,375
...in these young students' minds.

263
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,625
Teach them defiance rather than obedience.

264
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:21,375
Show that man may pursue nature
to her hiding places and stop death.

265
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:24,375
Not slow it down, but stop it entirely!

266
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,292
Silence. Silence!

267
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:42,333
How exactly do you propose
to teach what is impossible?

268
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,083
Composite subject, the body.

269
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,375
That of a shopkeeper,
delivered mere moments after expiration.

270
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,458
The brain laid bare but functional,

271
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:56,166
the spinal branches
and vagal nerves intact.

272
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,958
You may observe the hair-thin scars.

273
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:01,667
No coarse stitching needed
by my own technique.

274
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,917
The arm, you see,

275
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,542
comes from another specimen,
that of a carpenter.

276
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:08,833
The muscles, ligaments,
nerves, all connected now.

277
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,958
Now, the spasmodic movement of the body

278
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,542
caused from the electric current,
this is not new.

279
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,625
It's not new. However,
the flow of energy through the body

280
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,292
follows a different notion entirely.

281
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,750
An Eastern notion called qi.

282
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:45,042
Now, it considers the vital flow of energy
both within and without.

283
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,792
I'm utilizing needles in six...

284
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,708
Quiet!

285
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:51,041
Sit down!

286
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,958
This is a hearing, Doctor,
not a carnival act.

287
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:58,000
You're not helping your cause, Victor.

288
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,667
This galvanic trickery will simply not do.

289
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,833
Trickery.

290
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,750
Trickery?

291
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,166
Are you sure?

292
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,667
That is not trickery. That is a decision.

293
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,083
Motor coordination between the eye
of one dead man and the arm of another,

294
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:23,708
infused with a new will
and the rudiments of understanding.

295
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:27,500
Understanding in a brain
that already died?

296
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:29,666
Release now.

297
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,875
Please.

298
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,418
"Please" always helps.

299
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,083
Turn that off at once.
At once, you charlatan.

300
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:42,042
This is the future. This is possible.

301
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,208
Why not study it? Why not quantify it?

302
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:46,875
This is unholy.

303
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:48,958
An abomination.

304
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,208
An obscenity!

305
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,833
God gives life, and God takes it, Victor.

306
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:58,417
Perhaps God is inept!

307
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,250
And it is we that must amend his mistakes!

308
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,875
Do not let these old fools
extinguish your voice!

309
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:08,333
The answers only come
when coaxed by disobedience,

310
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:11,416
free of fear and cowardly dogma!

311
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,083
Professor Krempe.

312
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:05,792
Baron Frankenstein,
my name is Heinrich Harlander,

313
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:08,625
and I carry with me
a letter of introduction

314
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,083
from your brother, William.

315
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,125
From my brother?

316
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:13,583
I asked for the privilege
of your acquaintance.

317
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:15,542
It won't take but a minute of your time.

318
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:16,875
-Please.
-Very well.

319
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,708
So William is coming
to see me, is that it?

320
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:24,166
Yeah, in a matter of days.

321
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:29,125
He wants to introduce you to his fiancée.
My niece, as it happens.

322
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:36,125
Elizabeth Harlander,
a very nice young lady,

323
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,541
fresh from convent life.

324
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:39,416
The photographs are mine.

325
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:42,958
William has become
quite successful in the world of finance.

326
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:44,750
He's making a name for himself.

327
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:47,000
Ha! A name? For himself?

328
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:52,541
Well, I'm afraid we both share that name,
whether we like it or not.

329
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,833
I read your article in <i>The Lancet.</i>

330
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:57,166
You really believe you can do it?

331
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,375
Assemble a man?

332
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:03,458
A full new body? And give it life?

333
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,125
You saw it today, didn't you?

334
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,542
What I saw was a crucifixion, really.

335
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:11,250
You were done for
before you uttered a word.

336
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:12,750
I still showed them.

337
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:14,625
What?

338
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:15,708
The truth.

339
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:18,083
They will forget by suppertime.

340
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,583
Yes, yes, yes.
But what did you think? Hmm?

341
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:25,625
I thought it was brilliant.

342
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,083
It was. I know.

343
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:30,958
But you are like a child, so excited,

344
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:34,208
clutching your new pet so tightly
that you're strangling it.

345
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,458
That is why I worry about you.

346
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:41,083
Can you contain your fire, Prometheus?

347
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:44,125
Or are you going to
burn your hands before delivering it?

348
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:47,541
Quite.

349
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,792
Please do not think me rude,
but my day has proven long enough,

350
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:55,042
and I believe myself totally unfit
for the company of strangers.

351
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,542
So if there's nothing more...

352
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:58,625
Oh, but there is. Much more.

353
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:03,583
I've taken quarters in Edinburgh.

354
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:07,083
Three days from now,
we are to meet with William and Elizabeth.

355
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:10,375
And that evening,
I will change your destiny.

356
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:14,000
I will show you something extraordinary.

357
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:35,166
The peach. The peach.
Turn the peach. Turn it.

358
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:38,333
You bit it again.

359
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:40,833
You're eating the peaches.

360
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,333
This is a memento mori.

361
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:49,333
The peach, symbol of life and youth,
and you bite into it?

362
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:51,625
-I was hungry, Kiki.
-Don't call me Kiki.

363
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,833
Baron Victor Frankenstein, sir.

364
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:57,000
You can leave.

365
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:58,750
Forgive me.

366
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:01,083
Welcome.

367
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,250
Herr Harlander.

368
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,792
A young art, photography.

369
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:07,083
Goodbye, Kiki.

370
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:09,166
Already a passion of mine.

371
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,083
Did you bring the papers?

372
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:13,583
Oh, thank you.

373
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:19,408
-You're extraordinary.
-Thank you.

374
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:21,583
Hmm.

375
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:27,625
You're using the nervous system
to deliver the surge of energy.

376
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:29,583
Are you not?

377
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:30,833
Correct.

378
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:34,917
And thus the sustainability
of the life force you command

379
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,375
is very brief, wanes, evaporates.

380
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
How so?

381
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,625
At the lecture,
you ended your demonstration out of pride.

382
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,583
But really,
because the galvanic life force

383
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,333
was already fading, was it not?

384
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:57,042
Are you yourself a surgeon, sir?

385
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:59,958
Yeah, once upon a time. An army surgeon.

386
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:02,625
Not a particularly skilled one, either.

387
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:05,875
But it allowed me
to secure the rudiments of my fortune.

388
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:07,875
I own a few ammunition factories.

389
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:10,875
-An arms merchant.
-A realist.

390
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:13,250
Are you familiar with the Evelyn Tables?

391
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,875
Of course. Acquired by Sir John Evelyn,

392
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:17,917
there are four planks,
meticulous dissection,

393
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,042
some of the oldest in Europe,
presenting the nerves,

394
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:22,000
veins and arteries of cadavers. What?

395
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:24,000
Yes. But there's a fifth one.

396
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:26,291
The most compelling one.

397
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:33,000
Exquisite, is it not?

398
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,708
Flesh rendered onto wood.

399
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:41,500
The cadaver lies on the plank,
is peeled away layer by layer,

400
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:45,292
and the remaining tissue is lacquered
with resin onto the wood.

401
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:48,500
-It showcases the lymphatic system.
-Yes.

402
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:52,542
Muslim medics called it
the secret circulatory system.

403
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:58,125
It moves a mere three liters of fluid,
but it's a vast network.

404
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:00,000
-Oh, it's remarkable.
-Yes.

405
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:05,166
Now for us, for you,
the important variation is here.

406
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:10,208
The ninth configuration. A very delicate,

407
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:13,667
almost ethereal structure
surrounding the heart.

408
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,125
It can distribute, but also store energy.

409
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:23,167
Yes, if you can access that
without destroying

410
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,958
-the surrounding tissue...
-No. Not through the front.

411
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:29,250
The back, spinal column,
thoracic curvature.

412
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:30,750
Of course.

413
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:36,250
Flow of energy, scarring and regeneration
beyond anyone's imagination.

414
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:37,708
Life eternal.

415
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:43,041
I will endow your pursuit
with unlimited resources.

416
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:47,250
And in exchange?

417
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,208
No need to become indelicate.

418
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,750
We're searchers for truth
and transcendence, kindred spirits.

419
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,292
I may in time
ask you for a favor in return,

420
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:02,375
but it's mostly the privilege to record
your process for posterity.

421
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:03,666
I work alone.

422
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,083
I'm very quiet.

423
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:09,250
William Frankenstein
and your niece, Herr Harlander.

424
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:14,208
I shall consider it.

425
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:16,625
I'll consider it.

426
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:18,958
Baron.

427
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:23,208
Don't pretend to be reasonable now.
It would be such a shame.

428
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:34,708
Victor.

429
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:36,083
William!

430
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:38,625
-Victor.
-Look at you.

431
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:41,542
My, you've grown.

432
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:43,208
Through no merit of my own.

433
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:46,041
May I introduce the woman I'm to marry.

434
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,250
Lady Elizabeth Harlander.

435
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:11,458
Absolutely delighted.

436
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:19,750
Can't say I was shocked
when you were expelled,

437
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:22,375
but the manner and virulence
of your expulsion,

438
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,625
uncalled for, I'm sure.

439
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:25,708
No, it was called for. I earned it.

440
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,083
I made it a point to earn it,
wouldn't you say, Herr Harlander?

441
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:30,666
It was quite an exit, I assure you.

442
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:33,333
Why provoke them?

443
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:37,416
Why not just carry on without calling
attention to yourself in such a manner?

444
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:41,125
How safe, even by your standards, William.

445
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,250
You almost sound like Father.

446
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:47,042
He was a most tactful man, our father.

447
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:50,750
He was precise, discreet, measured.

448
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:55,292
I, on the other hand, fail to see
why modesty is considered a virtue at all.

449
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:57,750
Victor's always been
one to harvest attention.

450
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:01,542
Even as children,
I mitigated his voice by staying silent.

451
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:04,500
Perhaps too much and far too many times,
wouldn't you say, Victor?

452
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:06,416
If life can be regenerated,

453
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:08,125
not as a mere simulation,

454
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:11,083
but as a divine act by physical,
chemical means,

455
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:13,000
why whisper it?

456
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
You laugh?

457
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:19,625
-You're amused?
-I must be, yes.

458
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,042
Are my ideas not clear?

459
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,583
You certainly expressed them
loudly enough.

460
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:25,000
Are they not worthwhile?

461
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:27,833
Ideas are not worthwhile by themselves,
I don't believe.

462
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,666
Enlighten me, please.

463
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:34,292
Take the war, for example.

464
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:37,083
William, cigar and brandy in my study?

465
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:41,208
Surely you've heard my niece
expound on the matter before.

466
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:43,458
You'll excuse us.

467
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:50,333
Pray, carry on. Ideas.

468
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:57,333
Well... honor, country, valor.

469
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:01,625
These surely are worthwhile,
elevated ideas by themselves,

470
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:02,750
wouldn't you agree?

471
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:06,375
-Mm-hmm.
-And nevertheless, men are dying for them.

472
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:08,875
In a decidedly un-elevated way,

473
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:11,833
face down in the mud, choking on blood,

474
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:13,208
screaming in pain.

475
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:17,292
Men that were fathers,
brothers or sons to someone out there.

476
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:19,292
Men that were fed, cleaned and nursed

477
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:21,333
and schooled into this world
by their mothers,

478
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:23,792
only to fall on a battlefield far away,

479
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:26,166
far from those that provoke
these tragedies.

480
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:31,291
Those men remain at home,
untouched by blood or bayonet,

481
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:35,458
their skin unpierced,
their blankets warm and clean.

482
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,792
That is what happens
when ideas are pursued by fools.

483
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,708
And you think me a fool?

484
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,541
Hmm?

485
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:47,916
Run to your brandy and cigars.

486
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:49,833
The boys are waiting.

487
00:35:56,333 --> 00:36:01,166
<i>How often a man believes
he's met an angel or a devil,</i>

488
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:04,916
<i>only to find it is all an illusion.</i>

489
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,041
The game of chess we play...

490
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:12,667
We play only against ourselves.

491
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:16,166
Help him.

492
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,750
Help him!

493
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:20,417
Here you go. Drink some.

494
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:45,368
You better come with me.

495
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,250
Nothing.

496
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:48,916
Sir, the watchman saw him.

497
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,375
Circling the ship. In the mist.

498
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:53,125
We all saw him drown.

499
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:54,333
Sir.

500
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:55,958
The men are terrified.

501
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,375
They think that man should be
surrendered to the ice

502
00:36:58,458 --> 00:36:59,708
and be done with this.

503
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:04,416
He is under my protection...

504
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,375
and the protection of the Crown!

505
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:24,708
<i>A few weeks later,
I rode with William and Harlander</i>

506
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:27,375
<i>to a lake near Vaduz across the channel.</i>

507
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:30,875
The tower was built as a water
filtration plant to irrigate the fields.

508
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:33,916
Public works, so construction
was abandoned at the start of the war.

509
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:36,875
Not this war, the one before.

510
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:39,666
Or the one before that,
I cannot quite remember.

511
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
<i>The moment I laid eyes on it...</i>

512
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:48,666
<i>The tower.</i>

513
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:52,792
<i>I could feel destiny calling.</i>

514
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:05,500
The structure's basically intact.

515
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,750
And there's a chute
going from top, right to the bottom.

516
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:11,125
I can arrange for your belongings.

517
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:13,083
We'll bring them from Edinburgh.

518
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:29,666
Anything you need or want
shall be granted.

519
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,125
-Anything?
-Anything.

520
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:45,292
I have secured William's
service for the duration of the project.

521
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,000
I'll need a holding cell.

522
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:49,500
-And an ice chamber close to the lab.
-William.

523
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:52,708
There are two pump reservoirs
at the base of the tower.

524
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:53,917
We'll repurpose those.

525
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,208
We shall need to recondition
the steam engines.

526
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:58,166
We'll need enough fuel
to make sure they run.

527
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,333
There and there,
four high-capacity voltaic batteries,

528
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:04,083
positive and negative polarity,

529
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:08,375
and a lightning rod system of pure silver
telescoping down into the lab.

530
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:13,541
Yes. My contractors can manufacture
any and all equipment you may require.

531
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,000
I take it then
that we have an understanding?

532
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:26,750
A bargain has been struck.

533
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,375
Bastard!

534
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:41,416
No. No. Not this one.

535
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:46,375
Aah. Open your mouth.

536
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:51,458
You, you're lucky to be hanged.
You would have died within the year.

537
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:54,042
Herr Harlander promised me
access to optimal specimens.

538
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,792
Yeah, that he may have, your lordship,

539
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:57,125
but as you well know,

540
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,792
crime doesn't pay, and it's a poor
showing of it we have here.

541
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:02,708
They're wretches every one of them.

542
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:04,042
I'm sorry about that.

543
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:06,125
That's a strong back.
This one will do.

544
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,208
Come back later.

545
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:44,458
<i>Confession?</i>

546
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:48,208
<i>I was intrigued.</i>

547
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:54,750
<i>What would such a delicate,
pious creature have to confess to?</i>

548
00:40:57,125 --> 00:41:00,458
<i>As luck would have it,
an opportunity presented itself,</i>

549
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,625
<i>and I...</i>

550
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:05,666
<i>I was about to find out.</i>

551
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:29,333
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

552
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:31,125
How long has it been

553
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:33,208
since your last confession, my daughter?

554
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,541
Barely a week, Father.
I was in a convent.

555
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:37,125
A week?

556
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:40,500
Tsk-tsk. Have you
so hastily committed sin?

557
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:41,917
I have.

558
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,916
Sin of intent, not deed.

559
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:46,542
-A man, is it?
-Yes.

560
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:47,958
My fiancé's brother.

561
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,583
Lust?

562
00:41:50,666 --> 00:41:51,500
Hatred.

563
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:53,292
Hatred...

564
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:56,667
-Hatred?
-The man is appalling, grotesque.

565
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,208
Harsh words.

566
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:00,917
Rather uncharitable, wouldn't you say?

567
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,458
Respectfully, Father,
you do not know this man.

568
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:07,000
He tries to control and manipulate
everything and everyone around him.

569
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:09,708
Like every tyrant,
he delights in playing the victim.

570
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,208
His only advantage, I would say,

571
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:14,000
is he's far cruder
than he believes himself to be.

572
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:15,875
Cruder?

573
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:18,250
Uh, pray explain yourself, my child.

574
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:21,083
For one, he's easy to spot.

575
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,291
You can see him...
even on a busy street on market day.

576
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:33,958
Tell me,
how soon did you spot me?

577
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:36,917
I saw you well before
you saw me, I can say that much.

578
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,167
Have you had supper?

579
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,000
I'm not that hungry, Baron.
Thank you.

580
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:41,791
Well, I for one am famished.

581
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:46,458
-Thank you, my good man.
-Thank you, sir.

582
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:48,916
What books did you buy, hmm? May I?

583
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:51,125
Guess.

584
00:42:51,791 --> 00:42:53,333
-Guess?
-Mm-hmm. I'd rather that you did.

585
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:54,416
Very well.

586
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,750
A romance...

587
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:04,083
Drenched in Mediterranean sun
and silk and the skirmishes of love.

588
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:06,708
Insulting, but unsurprising.

589
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:08,791
Really?

590
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:16,166
-Insects?
-Mm.

591
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:20,541
My interest in science
leans towards the smallest things.

592
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:23,958
Moving with nature,
perhaps the rhythms of God.

593
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:29,416
I've always searched for something
more pure, marvelous.

594
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,208
Is that what you were seeking
in the convent?

595
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:38,958
In a way.

596
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:42,125
Was it worth it?

597
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:45,292
Is anything?

598
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:55,708
Permit me, sister.

599
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:01,625
This hardly seems appropriate.

600
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:03,250
Is anything?

601
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:08,875
Very well.

602
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:21,250
Laughter!

603
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,875
<i>And for the very first time,</i>

604
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,625
<i>I became more interested in life</i>

605
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:32,083
<i>and somewhat less interested in death.</i>

606
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:55,291
The main rod
has a fast bolting system.

607
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,333
Did you use an alloy?

608
00:44:58,333 --> 00:44:59,792
Copper and zinc.

609
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:02,750
This is... This simply will not do.
Start over.

610
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:05,208
Pure silver is a perfect conductor.

611
00:45:06,916 --> 00:45:09,042
William, you must stay behind. Please.

612
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:11,042
I trust you above anyone else.

613
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,416
Only for a few more days.

614
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,916
You're not going to catch her.

615
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:30,417
Beautiful. Beautiful.

616
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,833
-Should we trap her or let her go?
-Mm...

617
00:45:33,416 --> 00:45:34,750
Trap her.

618
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,083
Now we have something in common.

619
00:45:39,791 --> 00:45:40,791
A prisoner.

620
00:45:41,291 --> 00:45:46,208
<i>As promised, William took dutiful
charge of the laboratory build and needs.</i>

621
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:50,333
Can you fix that
over there, please?

622
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:51,500
Go, help.

623
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,125
<i>He followed
my instructions to the letter.</i>

624
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,958
The battery.

625
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:09,542
It's all pure silver now.

626
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:13,125
Conduction points
corresponding to the lymphatic system,

627
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,167
which was quite complex.

628
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,167
-But I managed.
-Mm-hmm.

629
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:02,917
Herr Harlander, thank you.
The party's delightful.

630
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,125
I hope we're not distracting you
from your research

631
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,791
to tend to me and Elizabeth.

632
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:12,458
Not at all.

633
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:16,000
She's young.
She can count on us to guard her.

634
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,375
I shall leave you your privacy.

635
00:47:21,458 --> 00:47:23,833
No need for subterfuge between us.

636
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:29,666
French porcelain,
chimes to a man's stream.

637
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:35,292
I am very near a solution,
an access point to the lymphatic system.

638
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:37,166
Ah, yeah, that.

639
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,083
It's been so long.

640
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:43,042
The war is waning.

641
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:47,083
And my funding will end with it.

642
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:49,625
You said your funds were unlimited.

643
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:51,125
My patience is not.

644
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:55,750
I have it on good authority that a battle
is to take place within a week.

645
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,875
The tide of war
will deliver its bounty to our shore.

646
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:03,125
A battlefield? The bodies will be mangled.

647
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:04,208
One week.

648
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:07,958
-One week?
-After that, history will pass us by.

649
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:12,958
Flush that for me, will you, Baron?

650
00:48:15,583 --> 00:48:19,125
<i>A week to determine
how to deliver the current.</i>

651
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:20,416
<i>Impossible.</i>

652
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:22,750
<i>What would I do?</i>

653
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,750
<i>I was close. I could feel it.</i>

654
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:26,291
<i>And then...</i>

655
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:29,417
<i>life got in the way.</i>

656
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,583
Oh.

657
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:33,875
I believe she missed you.

658
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,583
I must warn you,
Elizabeth,

659
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:39,041
-I've been working on a dissection.
-It's beautiful.

660
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:42,916
Does it shock you?

661
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:46,250
Reminds me
of martyrdom paintings.

662
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:52,042
Pain is gone.

663
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:55,375
You can see God's design
in the symmetry and the shapes.

664
00:48:57,791 --> 00:48:59,125
Elizabeth.

665
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:02,583
I must confess something to you.

666
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,583
I have a belief in the marvelous
and so do you.

667
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:11,958
There is a bond between us.
Can you feel it?

668
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:15,750
An almost physical one.
I truly believe it to be something else.

669
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:26,958
Believing something does not make it true.

670
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:31,583
Then why are you here?

671
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:41,250
Beautiful creature, is she not?

672
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:47,250
Remote. Entirely bewitching, but so odd.

673
00:49:53,083 --> 00:49:54,166
Three hearts.

674
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,916
Multiple eyes. White blood.

675
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,375
And a fascinating lack of choice.

676
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,083
I don't understand.

677
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:06,333
Choice is the seat of the soul.

678
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:10,958
The one gift God granted us.

679
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:17,208
Elizabeth...

680
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,458
I have chosen.

681
00:50:23,041 --> 00:50:24,042
Good night.

682
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:31,791
Elizabeth!

683
00:50:35,041 --> 00:50:36,041
Elizabeth!

684
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:42,041
<i>I thought I had failed.</i>

685
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,500
<i>I thought it was
entirely over. I thought...</i>

686
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,000
<i>And I thought...</i>

687
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:50,208
<i>And I...</i>

688
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:52,250
<i>The symmetry.</i>

689
00:50:58,625 --> 00:51:00,667
God's symmetry. Yes, yes.

690
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:15,250
Yes.

691
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:31,541
<i>Placing the battery
above the lymphatic system.</i>

692
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:33,875
<i>I had found the key.</i>

693
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:36,416
<i>Nothing could stop me now.</i>

694
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:39,541
<i>Nothing.</i>

695
00:51:42,416 --> 00:51:44,458
No! No, do not take any bodies

696
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:47,583
from the top or the bottom
of the pile unless I mark them.

697
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:49,750
Ice or rot may have destroyed the tissue.

698
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:52,166
Look only in the middle.

699
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:02,542
Abundance can be disorienting
unless one hones one's aim.

700
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:05,333
I'm favoring tall specimens, long limbs.

701
00:52:05,416 --> 00:52:07,042
Scale will make the work easier.

702
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:08,250
I like that.

703
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:11,333
Perfection.

704
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:14,208
And why not, dear Baron?

705
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:17,125
Indeed, why not?

706
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:19,458
Look for a head that's intact.

707
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:21,833
Put that one in the cart.

708
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:28,375
Set that one over there.

709
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:29,916
Bring the others.

710
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:36,792
Oh, good God.

711
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:51,916
Do you mind?

712
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,708
It is finished.

713
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:06,833
Herr Harlander!

714
00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:09,208
A storm is coming!

715
00:56:11,875 --> 00:56:12,875
My cane.

716
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:15,375
My cane!

717
00:56:15,791 --> 00:56:17,125
My cane, in the handle.

718
00:56:26,791 --> 00:56:27,625
Mercury.

719
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:29,625
-Are you ill?
-Thank you.

720
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:42,583
Is it... syphilis?

721
00:56:45,375 --> 00:56:46,541
Yeah, I'm dying.

722
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:51,625
One night with Venus,
a lifetime with Mercury.

723
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:52,916
Isn't that the phrase?

724
00:56:53,666 --> 00:56:54,625
What stage?

725
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:55,542
Secondary?

726
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:58,167
We both know the precise schedule.

727
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,542
It starts to eat away my bones,

728
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:06,250
orbital, cheek, teeth, jaw, skull,
exposing my brain.

729
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:10,166
Tumors, madness, excruciating pain.

730
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:12,792
One fine morning,

731
00:57:12,875 --> 00:57:15,833
I will start to scream
and I will never stop.

732
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:19,750
I cannot face such a vulgar demise.

733
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:23,083
Which brings me to my one condition.

734
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:27,125
Our deal. As agreed, in exchange

735
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:30,375
for my generous intervention
on your behalf.

736
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:34,791
And as we give life to our new Adam,

737
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:37,833
I want to be placed
in this new perfect body.

738
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:41,500
No.

739
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:44,875
-No, no.
-Yes.

740
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:46,833
Not now. Not now!

741
00:57:46,916 --> 00:57:49,833
-Precisely now.
-We'll talk about this after, not now.

742
00:57:49,916 --> 00:57:51,041
There is no after!

743
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:54,208
There is no after.

744
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:41,958
I gave you everything you wanted!

745
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:44,208
I give you everything you ask for.

746
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:45,625
Name it, it's yours.

747
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:48,000
Even Elizabeth.

748
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:51,041
Please.

749
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:53,625
"Please" always helps.

750
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:57,375
The disease has spread all inside of you.

751
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:59,583
It's systemic, and you know it.

752
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:01,583
Every organ in you is polluted.

753
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:03,792
Your brain, your blood, it's all polluted.

754
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:05,417
But my money's not, is that it?

755
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,583
It's impossible.

756
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:12,250
Now, all you need to say
is one simple word.

757
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:14,458
"Yes," no more and no less.

758
00:59:14,541 --> 00:59:16,458
No! Do you understand? No!

759
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:29,333
What are you doing?

760
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:30,833
Stop!

761
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,417
Stop.

762
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,875
If we lose that, we have nothing.
We both lose.

763
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:37,667
I will be the eagle
that feasts on your liver!

764
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:38,916
Please, stop!

765
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:41,083
Herr Harlander. Herr Harlander!

766
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:51,291
Hold on, look at me!

767
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:56,375
No! Herr Harlander!

768
01:00:33,208 --> 01:00:34,375
No, no. No!

769
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:08,083
No, no, no!

770
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:09,708
No!

771
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:28,291
No! No! No!

772
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:40,125
You lied to me.

773
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:43,375
You lied.

774
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,250
<i>Victor!</i>

775
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:54,500
<i>Victor!</i>

776
01:03:33,416 --> 01:03:34,791
No, please.

777
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:03,250
Look. Same.

778
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,041
Sun.

779
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:17,375
Sun. Light.

780
01:04:20,333 --> 01:04:21,375
Face it.

781
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:24,167
Sunlight. The sun is...

782
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,833
The sun is life.

783
01:04:27,416 --> 01:04:30,083
Ah, the warmth. Huh?

784
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:32,208
Yes! Yes.

785
01:04:41,708 --> 01:04:43,083
Victor.

786
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:46,250
Victor.

787
01:04:49,708 --> 01:04:51,291
-Victor.
-Yes.

788
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:54,666
Yes, yes, yes. Of course you are.

789
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:56,458
Of course you are.

790
01:05:01,916 --> 01:05:03,625
Victor.

791
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:11,833
The mail, sir.

792
01:05:11,916 --> 01:05:13,833
Letters from the old estate.

793
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:15,000
Geneva.

794
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:17,916
-Is there anything from my uncle?
-No.

795
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:25,083
Perhaps we should
pay them a visit.

796
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:30,208
Careful. Look. Look down.

797
01:05:32,333 --> 01:05:34,500
Water. Water.

798
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:37,792
Water.

799
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:39,583
Yes, water.

800
01:05:39,666 --> 01:05:41,000
-Victor.
-No, I'm Victor.

801
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:42,417
That's water. Come here.

802
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,250
-Victor.
-Come now, come. All right, good.

803
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:46,000
We're going to take a big step.

804
01:05:46,083 --> 01:05:47,333
We'll do it together. Ready?

805
01:05:47,416 --> 01:05:49,125
This way, like this.

806
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:52,083
No, not like that. This way.

807
01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:54,583
Oh, no, no, no. Hot, hot.

808
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:56,167
No, don't touch. Don't touch that.

809
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:57,708
It's hot.

810
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:06,750
Sit. Very good. Very good. Yes.

811
01:06:08,583 --> 01:06:10,833
Yes. Now, look what I have here.

812
01:06:10,916 --> 01:06:12,667
Look at this. What is this thing?

813
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:14,750
What is this strange thing? Careful.

814
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:17,208
You're very strong.

815
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:20,333
Yes. And like this. Huh?

816
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:24,125
Yes, you want another?
Yes, this one goes right here.

817
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:25,208
Key.

818
01:06:26,291 --> 01:06:27,750
Victor.

819
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:32,125
This will keep you nice and warm.

820
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:34,375
Nice blanket to keep you warm.

821
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:36,791
-Victor.
-All right.

822
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:39,541
You stay.

823
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:41,916
You stay here now.

824
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:45,291
Stay here now.

825
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,458
I'll be back. All right. Stay there.

826
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:53,292
Victor.

827
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:56,416
No, no, no, no, no. It's all right.

828
01:06:57,083 --> 01:06:58,083
I'll come back.

829
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,333
Victor.

830
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:08,500
Victor.

831
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:11,500
<i>Everything was new to him.</i>

832
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:16,750
<i>Warmth, cold, light, darkness.</i>

833
01:07:17,541 --> 01:07:19,541
<i>And I was there to mold him.</i>

834
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:23,625
<i>I never considered
what would come after creation.</i>

835
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,958
<i>And having reached the edge of the earth,</i>

836
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:30,375
<i>there was no horizon left.</i>

837
01:07:33,458 --> 01:07:35,875
<i>The achievement felt unnatural.</i>

838
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:41,958
<i>Void of meaning.</i>

839
01:07:44,583 --> 01:07:46,375
<i>And this troubled me so.</i>

840
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:49,833
Your men, they wish to go back.

841
01:07:49,916 --> 01:07:51,292
Yes?

842
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:52,666
Probably.

843
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:57,000
But the moment we're free,
we're setting sails forwards.

844
01:07:57,083 --> 01:07:58,375
No matter the cost.

845
01:07:58,458 --> 01:08:00,041
You share my madness.

846
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:06,083
Perhaps there is a finer point
in me telling you my story.

847
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:08,291
Whether there is or isn't, Baron...

848
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:12,458
I'd like to hear it.

849
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:16,208
<i>Weeks passed,</i>

850
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:20,083
<i>and as his strength increased rapidly,
mine waned.</i>

851
01:08:20,708 --> 01:08:24,166
<i>Alas, no further language
or development occurred.</i>

852
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:26,833
No, no, no, no, no, no.

853
01:08:27,833 --> 01:08:30,083
Down, down, down, down.

854
01:08:30,625 --> 01:08:31,625
Yes, there we are.

855
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:33,833
There we are. Stay there. Stay.

856
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:38,208
Yes, that's you.

857
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:40,583
That's you. All right?

858
01:08:46,708 --> 01:08:48,666
Oh, yes, this is healing rather nicely.

859
01:08:50,666 --> 01:08:51,750
I'm tired.

860
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:55,333
I have not slept.

861
01:08:56,833 --> 01:09:00,958
Not a winky-dinky-doo of sleep for me.

862
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,958
Tending to you.

863
01:09:03,916 --> 01:09:05,250
I've finished shaving you.

864
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:12,417
No, no, stop, stop.

865
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,833
Let go. No, no, no, no, no, no. Open.

866
01:09:14,916 --> 01:09:17,083
Open your hand. Open. Open it.

867
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:22,333
What are you doing?

868
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:24,583
Look. Look what you've done.

869
01:09:24,666 --> 01:09:27,791
You have to listen to me.
You have to listen. I said drop it.

870
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,291
Stupidity! No. Stop.

871
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:33,000
Come here.

872
01:09:33,083 --> 01:09:35,500
-Victor.
-No, don't touch me!

873
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:37,083
Don't ever touch me!

874
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:45,125
Come here.

875
01:09:46,166 --> 01:09:47,833
I didn't do this. You did this.

876
01:09:53,208 --> 01:09:54,291
The wound.

877
01:09:55,541 --> 01:09:56,541
It's closed.

878
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:58,417
But how?

879
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:02,791
All right.

880
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:07,291
No, no, no.

881
01:10:08,666 --> 01:10:09,666
No.

882
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:12,791
No.

883
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:16,833
All right. All right.

884
01:10:23,666 --> 01:10:25,291
I'm sure everything's all right.

885
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:29,500
We'll be there soon enough.

886
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:33,708
I know you have thoughts. I know.

887
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:34,958
I know you do.

888
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:37,667
Somewhere in there.
Somewhere in there you have thoughts.

889
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,791
Hmm? Don't you?

890
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:41,708
Something you might want to say?

891
01:10:41,791 --> 01:10:43,875
However jumbled, however confused?

892
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:45,625
Hmm? Something?

893
01:10:46,416 --> 01:10:47,458
Am I presuming too much?

894
01:10:47,541 --> 01:10:48,583
Victor.

895
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:51,708
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

896
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:53,667
This much we have established.

897
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,958
That is my name. My name is Victor.

898
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:59,208
Is there anything else that you can say?
Anything at all? Hmm?

899
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:01,917
Anything? Anything?

900
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,958
Um, sun, hmm?

901
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:08,833
Cold. Rain. Blood. Anything.

902
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:10,875
Boot. Can you say "boot"?

903
01:11:11,708 --> 01:11:12,500
Victor.

904
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:17,083
No, yes, no, yes! How about...

905
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:18,875
How about "hand"? Can you say "hand"?

906
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:21,750
Hand. Hand.

907
01:11:24,666 --> 01:11:27,333
Oh. Oh, oh. You are afraid of me?

908
01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:30,167
You're afraid of me?

909
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:32,500
Why? Why would you be afraid of me?

910
01:11:32,583 --> 01:11:34,041
I'm not going to hurt you.

911
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:36,416
I'm not going to hurt you. I made you.

912
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,208
I'm your maker! Stop it!

913
01:11:54,208 --> 01:11:55,208
Oh.

914
01:11:56,458 --> 01:11:58,291
You're here. You're really here.

915
01:11:59,166 --> 01:12:00,875
Come on, then. Come, come.

916
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:04,833
I have to tell you.
I have so much to show you, Elizabeth.

917
01:12:04,916 --> 01:12:06,833
You won't believe it.
It's absolutely marvelous.

918
01:12:06,916 --> 01:12:08,542
Come, come,
I'll show you my notes first.

919
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:10,208
Is my uncle here?

920
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
What?

921
01:12:12,666 --> 01:12:13,792
My uncle, is he here?

922
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:14,875
No, no.

923
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:17,000
No, I'm alone. He's not here.

924
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:19,875
-He's... He'll be back in a few days.
-You don't look very well, Victor.

925
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:22,833
Oh, I've never felt better!
I've never had a clearer mind! Come, come!

926
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:24,541
Are you running a fever?

927
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:27,458
I am just very excited
to see you.

928
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:29,917
I'm exalted.
The spirits have lifted me so much.

929
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,250
Absolutely marvelous...

930
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:34,416
Victor...

931
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:39,458
Victor. Victor.

932
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,875
Who hurt you?

933
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:57,500
I have to show you this, William.

934
01:14:58,541 --> 01:14:59,958
Let me organize it for you.

935
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:02,333
And I have something to show to you.

936
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:06,000
I've spoken to the Royal Medical Society.

937
01:15:06,708 --> 01:15:09,166
-They're interested in seeing you.
-No, no, no, not yet.

938
01:15:09,833 --> 01:15:11,083
I'm not quite ready yet.

939
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:14,333
I thought
that's what you always wanted.

940
01:15:18,416 --> 01:15:19,541
The man.

941
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,208
-The man downstairs.
-You saw him?

942
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:25,166
Is he a patient? A victim?

943
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:29,125
His wounds. You wounded him like that.

944
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:31,917
No, no, no. It was the world
that hurt him, Elizabeth.

945
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,791
I... I gave him life.

946
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:37,291
I gave him life.

947
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,041
Up, up, up.

948
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:41,875
Come on.

949
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:45,167
There, there, there...

950
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,541
He's still getting
used to his surroundings.

951
01:15:51,125 --> 01:15:53,083
It is strong, William.

952
01:15:53,166 --> 01:15:55,125
-You did it.
-It's so strong.

953
01:15:55,791 --> 01:15:56,791
You did it.

954
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:59,042
All its systems are functional.

955
01:15:59,125 --> 01:16:00,333
All healing.

956
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:04,583
And the healing is erratic, yes.

957
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:06,916
But exceptional.

958
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:16,042
Why is he chained here?

959
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:17,792
For his own safety and for mine,

960
01:16:17,875 --> 01:16:21,542
and it's easy to clean
and, uh, maintain it.

961
01:16:21,625 --> 01:16:23,291
And it doesn't know any better.

962
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,500
But you do.

963
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:29,916
Does Harlander know?

964
01:16:32,375 --> 01:16:34,917
We have to prepare everything
for the moment he returns.

965
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,875
-Of course.
-And have everything presentable.

966
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,500
Is it intelligent?

967
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:48,125
Victor, is it intelligent?

968
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:05,250
I can't fathom
how exactly you did what you did,

969
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:07,750
but its dimension does not escape me.

970
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:14,000
Victor, did you ever ask yourself,

971
01:17:15,041 --> 01:17:16,916
of all the parts that make that man,

972
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:20,500
which one holds the soul?

973
01:17:26,458 --> 01:17:27,958
No, I didn't.

974
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:32,541
There's something so disquieting
about that creature down there.

975
01:17:33,208 --> 01:17:36,500
Askew, like a figure peeking around
a fun house mirror.

976
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:38,458
But animated.

977
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:40,375
Animated by what?

978
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:46,375
Does it hurt?

979
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,500
A leaf?

980
01:18:55,958 --> 01:18:56,958
For me?

981
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:58,958
Thank you.

982
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:04,375
Isn't it beautiful?

983
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:06,875
This is for me?

984
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:09,958
I'm Elizabeth.

985
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:13,583
Can you say "Elizabeth"?

986
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:15,291
Elizabeth.

987
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:19,166
My throat makes sounds.

988
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:20,833
Elizabeth.

989
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:38,916
I'm going to go now.

990
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:56,958
Eliza... Beth.

991
01:19:58,833 --> 01:20:00,583
You should not go near it.

992
01:20:02,666 --> 01:20:03,666
"It"?

993
01:20:05,666 --> 01:20:07,666
It. Yes.

994
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,792
I believe there is life in it,

995
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:13,375
but not the spark of intelligence
that I had intended.

996
01:20:13,458 --> 01:20:15,083
Perhaps not as you understand it.

997
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:16,792
Something went wrong.

998
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:19,292
A blockage, a suture, a connection.

999
01:20:19,375 --> 01:20:21,875
You, the great Victor Frankenstein,
you made a mistake?

1000
01:20:21,958 --> 01:20:24,167
The Creature knows but one word,
and one word alone.

1001
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:26,208
"Victor, Victor, Victor, Victor."

1002
01:20:26,291 --> 01:20:28,792
It just parrots it
without rhyme or reason.

1003
01:20:28,875 --> 01:20:31,875
Perhaps for the time being
that word means everything to him.

1004
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:35,292
What if in being anew,
the spirit that animates him is simpler,

1005
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:36,542
-purer...
-Purer?

1006
01:20:36,625 --> 01:20:39,291
Purer than that of the common man?

1007
01:20:43,291 --> 01:20:44,833
What if, unrestrained by sin,

1008
01:20:44,916 --> 01:20:47,792
our creator's breath came
into its wounded flesh directly?

1009
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:50,083
Good God, Elizabeth.

1010
01:20:51,916 --> 01:20:53,958
If I could force myself to believe it,

1011
01:20:54,041 --> 01:20:58,083
it would be my inclination to see
attraction in you for that thing.

1012
01:20:58,166 --> 01:20:59,625
Understanding.

1013
01:21:00,625 --> 01:21:01,833
In those eyes I saw pain,

1014
01:21:01,916 --> 01:21:03,958
and what is pain
if not evidence of intelligence?

1015
01:21:04,041 --> 01:21:05,750
What about my pain?

1016
01:21:05,833 --> 01:21:07,458
What about what you have denied me?

1017
01:21:08,916 --> 01:21:10,500
What my heart wants...

1018
01:21:11,875 --> 01:21:13,625
Your heart?

1019
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:17,583
Of all the human anatomy,

1020
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:20,333
that is the organ
furthest from your understanding.

1021
01:21:21,333 --> 01:21:23,708
Only monsters play God, Baron.

1022
01:21:29,166 --> 01:21:32,000
Purer than the common man, hmm?

1023
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:39,500
And I, somehow, the villain. Mm-hmm.

1024
01:21:40,875 --> 01:21:42,625
Your heart is pure?

1025
01:21:43,375 --> 01:21:44,916
I assure you it isn't.

1026
01:21:45,416 --> 01:21:47,125
I should know. I put it there.

1027
01:21:47,625 --> 01:21:48,625
Up.

1028
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:00,958
Let us try again.

1029
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:05,291
Now give me your leg.

1030
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:07,166
Leg!

1031
01:22:07,666 --> 01:22:09,416
Give me your leg!

1032
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:12,750
Pain is evidence of intelligence,
is it not?

1033
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:15,458
Well, let's test the theory.

1034
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:17,458
Give me your leg!

1035
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:19,208
Leg!

1036
01:22:20,083 --> 01:22:20,917
Leg!

1037
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,792
Come on!

1038
01:22:22,875 --> 01:22:24,166
Give it to me, you beast!

1039
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:28,041
Give me your leg!

1040
01:22:29,958 --> 01:22:31,041
Leg!

1041
01:22:34,125 --> 01:22:35,708
Victor!

1042
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:38,916
Victor!

1043
01:22:41,375 --> 01:22:46,291
Victor! Victor!

1044
01:22:46,916 --> 01:22:47,958
What is it, Victor?

1045
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:51,375
Come. Come.

1046
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:53,916
I failed. I made a mistake.

1047
01:22:54,666 --> 01:22:56,583
-No, you didn't fail. I saw your papers.
-I did.

1048
01:22:56,666 --> 01:22:58,708
-It's perfect.
-The Creature is extremely dangerous.

1049
01:22:58,791 --> 01:23:00,625
There's not... Victor.

1050
01:23:01,125 --> 01:23:03,042
Let's wait for Harlander
and discuss together.

1051
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:05,541
William, there is something
you should know.

1052
01:23:06,333 --> 01:23:07,542
Something I have to show you.

1053
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:16,375
-Ha... Harlander...
-In a fit of rage, he killed him.

1054
01:23:22,708 --> 01:23:25,875
Do you understand now
why I was hesitant to share this with you?

1055
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,208
And certainly not with Elizabeth.

1056
01:23:31,083 --> 01:23:33,500
S... So what's to be done now?

1057
01:23:34,125 --> 01:23:34,875
What?

1058
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:36,583
-What's to be done?
-"What's to be done"?

1059
01:23:36,666 --> 01:23:38,375
You must take Elizabeth back to Vienna.

1060
01:23:38,458 --> 01:23:41,708
Tell her something urgent came up
and you have to leave immediately.

1061
01:23:41,791 --> 01:23:43,250
Keep her in the dark.

1062
01:23:44,541 --> 01:23:46,000
For her own safety.

1063
01:23:46,083 --> 01:23:47,500
You have to do as I say.

1064
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:50,458
We'll be back in no time.
But for now, this is for the best.

1065
01:23:51,708 --> 01:23:53,750
Now get in the carriage, please.

1066
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:08,916
The Creature,
what's its lifespan, you think?

1067
01:24:09,916 --> 01:24:12,666
Brief. Very brief, I'm sure.

1068
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:01,125
I have the most terrible feeling.

1069
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:06,375
What is it?

1070
01:25:07,666 --> 01:25:08,958
Turn the carriage around.

1071
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:11,500
You go to Vienna.

1072
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:15,916
Turn the carriage around or I will jump.
He's going to kill him.

1073
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,958
Say one word.

1074
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:28,583
One word more. Anything.

1075
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:30,583
Make me save you.

1076
01:25:35,916 --> 01:25:37,708
-Victor.
-Mm-hmm.

1077
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:46,958
Elizabeth.

1078
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:30,833
Victor! Victor!

1079
01:26:36,708 --> 01:26:38,625
Victor!

1080
01:26:39,333 --> 01:26:41,750
Victor!

1081
01:27:31,458 --> 01:27:33,625
<i>But that was not the end of it.</i>

1082
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:37,083
In seeking life, I created death.

1083
01:27:43,333 --> 01:27:45,958
It would seem
I need to address my men again.

1084
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:51,208
Don't worry.

1085
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
They'll listen to me.

1086
01:27:57,125 --> 01:27:58,417
No, no, stop!

1087
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,375
Do not harm him! I'm here.

1088
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:02,667
Take me.

1089
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:03,958
Go on, beast.

1090
01:28:04,041 --> 01:28:07,583
Kill us both. Confirm your maker's tale.

1091
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:18,041
My maker... told his tale.

1092
01:28:23,875 --> 01:28:26,666
Then I will tell you mine.

1093
01:28:42,791 --> 01:28:44,083
Victor!

1094
01:28:44,166 --> 01:28:48,333
Victor! Victor! Victor!

1095
01:28:48,416 --> 01:28:52,708
<i>I called your name
and understood I was alone.</i>

1096
01:32:52,791 --> 01:32:54,125
-What is that?
-Shoot at it!

1097
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:55,875
Shoot it!

1098
01:33:00,958 --> 01:33:02,333
Did you get it?

1099
01:33:05,541 --> 01:33:06,625
Where is it?

1100
01:33:27,083 --> 01:33:29,000
<i>My wounds had healed.</i>

1101
01:33:31,916 --> 01:33:35,625
<i>But I felt cold, so cold.</i>

1102
01:35:08,541 --> 01:35:10,458
-Can you start the fire?
-All right.

1103
01:35:10,541 --> 01:35:12,625
And I'll repair the corral
as soon as I can.

1104
01:35:19,333 --> 01:35:20,708
You all right, then? Did you get it?

1105
01:35:20,791 --> 01:35:23,292
Nah, we looked everywhere.
Couldn't find that thing.

1106
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:25,000
Though we shot at it two times.

1107
01:35:25,083 --> 01:35:27,250
Blood trail died
about a mile from here.

1108
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:29,250
All right. Come in. Come in.

1109
01:35:29,833 --> 01:35:33,958
We followed it for a while
and then it disappeared. Gone.

1110
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:36,042
What was it? Was it a bear?

1111
01:35:36,125 --> 01:35:39,417
That was no bear or human.
I've never seen anything like it.

1112
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:40,875
Was it a ghost, then?

1113
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:44,208
It was no ghost. We drew blood.
It was flesh and bone.

1114
01:35:44,291 --> 01:35:45,542
Come, come. Over here.

1115
01:35:45,625 --> 01:35:47,042
Tell me more about what you saw.

1116
01:35:47,125 --> 01:35:50,042
Anna-Maria, take your grandfather
over by the fireplace.

1117
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:51,708
Make sure he's comfortable.

1118
01:35:52,791 --> 01:35:54,291
Over here, Grandfather.

1119
01:35:56,375 --> 01:35:58,666
We went deep into the forest.
Couldn't find it.

1120
01:36:04,541 --> 01:36:05,917
We will get it.

1121
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,666
-It'll take time.
-Yeah.

1122
01:36:08,666 --> 01:36:10,750
Anna-Maria, come.

1123
01:36:10,833 --> 01:36:12,667
Come, love. Help me outside.

1124
01:36:23,375 --> 01:36:25,375
<i>The old man moved me.</i>

1125
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:32,708
And his unseeing eyes were full of wisdom.

1126
01:36:45,541 --> 01:36:47,542
<i>These people possessed a sound.</i>

1127
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,833
<i>Used it to tell each other</i>

1128
01:36:50,916 --> 01:36:54,500
<i>about feelings and ideas.</i>

1129
01:36:56,166 --> 01:36:58,375
<i>They called them words.</i>

1130
01:37:01,708 --> 01:37:02,791
Pay attention.

1131
01:37:03,666 --> 01:37:04,666
What is this?

1132
01:37:05,166 --> 01:37:06,166
A boy.

1133
01:37:07,416 --> 01:37:09,208
-And again.
-A boy.

1134
01:37:10,208 --> 01:37:11,416
Very good, my child.

1135
01:37:12,916 --> 01:37:13,792
And this?

1136
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:16,000
An... An eye.

1137
01:37:16,791 --> 01:37:18,542
-And again.
-An eye.

1138
01:37:18,625 --> 01:37:21,458
Yeah. Well done. Well done, my girl.

1139
01:37:21,541 --> 01:37:23,708
-Eye.
-And this one?

1140
01:37:23,791 --> 01:37:24,750
The hand.

1141
01:37:24,833 --> 01:37:26,875
-Very good.
-Hand.

1142
01:37:27,791 --> 01:37:28,625
Give us a hand.

1143
01:37:28,708 --> 01:37:31,083
Tie a rope around
the biggest one back there.

1144
01:37:31,166 --> 01:37:33,708
<i>I longed
to be part of this family.</i>

1145
01:37:34,333 --> 01:37:36,292
We'll need more kindling
before the winter.

1146
01:37:36,375 --> 01:37:38,000
We'll take a few trips.

1147
01:37:38,625 --> 01:37:40,750
<i>To be their benefactor.</i>

1148
01:37:40,833 --> 01:37:42,792
We'll need larger trunks
for the structure.

1149
01:37:42,875 --> 01:37:43,750
All right.

1150
01:37:43,833 --> 01:37:46,750
<i>What could
I possibly do for them?</i>

1151
01:37:52,208 --> 01:37:55,167
Anna-Maria! Father!

1152
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:57,458
Come! Come and see!

1153
01:37:58,458 --> 01:38:01,000
Look, Anna-Maria!

1154
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:02,875
Look, there's more! Look!

1155
01:38:05,083 --> 01:38:06,625
Who could have done this?

1156
01:38:09,875 --> 01:38:11,666
The Spirit of the Forest.

1157
01:38:13,291 --> 01:38:14,541
We should thank him.

1158
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:17,250
Thank you.

1159
01:38:17,333 --> 01:38:20,042
Say, "Thank you, Spirit of the Forest."

1160
01:38:20,125 --> 01:38:22,917
Thank you.
Thank you, Spirit of the Forest.

1161
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,666
Thank you.

1162
01:38:25,375 --> 01:38:26,833
Come. Look over here.

1163
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:34,541
Thank you.

1164
01:38:36,625 --> 01:38:40,125
<i>From then on,
I became their invisible guardian.</i>

1165
01:38:40,666 --> 01:38:43,125
<i>The Spirit of the Forest.</i>

1166
01:38:44,041 --> 01:38:49,166
<i>And on occasion, they too
extended a small kindness towards me.</i>

1167
01:38:50,333 --> 01:38:52,541
<i>Clothes, bread.</i>

1168
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:56,791
<i>And for a moment,</i>

1169
01:38:57,375 --> 01:39:00,416
<i>a brief, brief moment,</i>

1170
01:39:01,208 --> 01:39:03,541
<i>the world and I were at peace.</i>

1171
01:39:11,208 --> 01:39:13,167
Come along. Come along.

1172
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:14,083
In you go. Yeah.

1173
01:39:14,166 --> 01:39:15,833
Make sure you close that gate.

1174
01:39:15,916 --> 01:39:17,583
Who could have done this?

1175
01:39:17,666 --> 01:39:19,791
The Spirit of the Forest, eh?

1176
01:39:20,916 --> 01:39:21,916
I got it.

1177
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:28,708
"And in the end,
the proud young man

1178
01:39:28,791 --> 01:39:32,000
could never find his missing hand."

1179
01:39:32,083 --> 01:39:36,250
"It turned to stone, his fortune gone,

1180
01:39:36,333 --> 01:39:39,917
and he lost his pride and lost his land."

1181
01:39:46,083 --> 01:39:48,125
Very good, my dear.

1182
01:39:48,208 --> 01:39:51,125
Beautifully read. Now try this one.

1183
01:40:01,125 --> 01:40:02,250
Wolves.

1184
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:48,875
<i>An idea,</i>

1185
01:40:49,833 --> 01:40:52,125
<i>a feeling became clear to me.</i>

1186
01:40:54,916 --> 01:40:57,333
<i>The hunter did not hate the wolf.</i>

1187
01:40:58,333 --> 01:41:00,625
<i>The wolf did not hate the sheep.</i>

1188
01:41:06,416 --> 01:41:09,416
<i>But violence felt inevitable between them.</i>

1189
01:41:10,333 --> 01:41:15,541
<i>Perhaps, I thought,
this was the way of the world.</i>

1190
01:41:16,666 --> 01:41:19,916
<i>It would hunt you and kill you</i>

1191
01:41:21,125 --> 01:41:23,208
<i>just for being who you are.</i>

1192
01:41:26,083 --> 01:41:28,416
The sheep will be sold
by the end of the month, Father.

1193
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:31,916
Then I'll take you,
Alma and Anna-Maria into town.

1194
01:41:32,708 --> 01:41:33,792
We'll go into the mountains,

1195
01:41:33,875 --> 01:41:35,917
hunt the wolves
and be back at the end of winter.

1196
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,958
I pray here alone every winter
and this year will be no different.

1197
01:41:41,041 --> 01:41:43,667
Please, Father, listen to reason.

1198
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:47,333
You do what you must and so will I.

1199
01:41:51,166 --> 01:41:52,625
You stubborn old goat.

1200
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:57,625
It's just you and I now, Spirit.

1201
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,000
Just you and I.

1202
01:42:00,583 --> 01:42:05,125
And I had formed
in my imagination many ways

1203
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:07,958
I would present myself to the old man.

1204
01:42:09,625 --> 01:42:11,500
<i>Would he fear me?</i>

1205
01:42:12,416 --> 01:42:13,583
<i>Welcome me?</i>

1206
01:42:15,041 --> 01:42:16,250
<i>Turn me away?</i>

1207
01:42:23,666 --> 01:42:24,500
Who goes there?

1208
01:42:30,916 --> 01:42:35,041
<i>With a single step,
I entered a different world.</i>

1209
01:42:36,375 --> 01:42:38,916
<i>One I had only seen from afar.</i>

1210
01:42:41,208 --> 01:42:42,916
Please, who is it?

1211
01:42:43,541 --> 01:42:44,541
Answer me.

1212
01:42:45,916 --> 01:42:46,916
Tell me.

1213
01:42:47,416 --> 01:42:48,916
Why are you here?

1214
01:42:51,250 --> 01:42:52,375
Travel.

1215
01:42:52,875 --> 01:42:54,583
Welcome, dear traveler.

1216
01:42:55,125 --> 01:43:01,333
Do not think me ungrateful for the company
if I ask you to procure a chair.

1217
01:43:01,416 --> 01:43:06,167
I... I find it difficult
being a good host.

1218
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:07,083
Yes.

1219
01:43:07,166 --> 01:43:10,833
My... My sight has failed me.

1220
01:43:11,791 --> 01:43:16,583
But there is bread
and brandy on the table.

1221
01:43:16,666 --> 01:43:17,875
Pray help yourself.

1222
01:43:20,083 --> 01:43:21,541
Bran... dy?

1223
01:43:22,875 --> 01:43:24,333
Your language.

1224
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,333
You have a hard time speaking it.

1225
01:43:28,916 --> 01:43:31,000
Are you not from these parts?

1226
01:43:36,791 --> 01:43:37,791
Are you afraid?

1227
01:43:39,625 --> 01:43:40,875
No need to be.

1228
01:43:45,875 --> 01:43:47,500
What are you afraid of?

1229
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:50,208
-Everything.
-Your...

1230
01:43:50,791 --> 01:43:53,250
Your hands are frozen

1231
01:43:53,791 --> 01:43:57,375
and you've been hurt, have you not?

1232
01:43:57,458 --> 01:43:58,458
Hurt?

1233
01:43:58,541 --> 01:44:05,333
Yes. Your hands and face have scars

1234
01:44:05,416 --> 01:44:06,875
and you are wearing uniform.

1235
01:44:06,958 --> 01:44:08,875
Were you injured in battle?

1236
01:44:12,125 --> 01:44:13,208
You were hiding

1237
01:44:14,083 --> 01:44:16,417
in the mill gears, were you not?

1238
01:44:18,291 --> 01:44:19,667
Ah!

1239
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,167
Yeah. Yeah. The Spirit of the Forest.

1240
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:25,875
Yes.

1241
01:44:25,958 --> 01:44:28,500
I cannot judge of your countenance,

1242
01:44:29,333 --> 01:44:31,583
but there is something in your voice

1243
01:44:31,666 --> 01:44:35,625
which persuades me
of your goodwill and kindness.

1244
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:38,041
-Kindness?
-Mm.

1245
01:44:39,625 --> 01:44:41,708
Stay with me.

1246
01:44:43,041 --> 01:44:45,625
Share my food and fire.

1247
01:44:46,125 --> 01:44:49,917
I would be delighted
to share what little I have with you

1248
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,666
and would be greatly helped
by your companionship.

1249
01:44:54,333 --> 01:44:57,458
And you... you could read to me.

1250
01:44:57,958 --> 01:44:59,375
-Read?
-Mm.

1251
01:45:00,125 --> 01:45:05,875
Make this your home and I your friend.

1252
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:08,791
Friend.

1253
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:14,958
Friend.

1254
01:45:23,333 --> 01:45:24,541
Friends.

1255
01:45:25,583 --> 01:45:29,625
<i>And it was then
that I read my first story,</i>

1256
01:45:30,625 --> 01:45:33,166
<i>and it was the first story.</i>

1257
01:45:34,375 --> 01:45:39,333
<i>I read about a man named Adam
and a woman named Eve,</i>

1258
01:45:40,208 --> 01:45:43,583
<i>about their time in the first garden.</i>

1259
01:45:44,458 --> 01:45:47,666
<i>I read about the rise of rival cities</i>

1260
01:45:48,166 --> 01:45:49,916
<i>and the collapse of a tower</i>

1261
01:45:50,416 --> 01:45:52,667
<i>and the wrath of a God.</i>

1262
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:57,667
<i>And I read about men
that fought dragons</i>

1263
01:45:57,750 --> 01:46:00,500
<i>and men who lost everything.</i>

1264
01:46:01,375 --> 01:46:03,041
<i>And time passed</i>

1265
01:46:03,625 --> 01:46:06,875
<i>and fell away with the leaves of autumn.</i>

1266
01:46:18,541 --> 01:46:21,666
Have you never seen the snow,
my dear friend?

1267
01:46:23,333 --> 01:46:27,083
It makes the world clean... and new.

1268
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,833
<i>"My name
is Ozymandias, King of Kings."</i>

1269
01:46:38,333 --> 01:46:41,666
<i>"Look on my works,
ye Mighty, and despair."</i>

1270
01:46:42,958 --> 01:46:45,208
<i>"No thing beside remains."</i>

1271
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:50,000
<i>"Round the decay of that colossal wreck,
boundless and bare."</i>

1272
01:46:50,083 --> 01:46:53,875
<i>"The lone and level sands
stretch far away."</i>

1273
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:58,458
<i>"My name is Ozymandias..."</i>

1274
01:47:05,208 --> 01:47:07,458
Are there more books
than this in the world?

1275
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:11,625
A few more, I'm sure.

1276
01:47:12,375 --> 01:47:13,791
Not here.

1277
01:47:15,833 --> 01:47:19,167
Last book on the left. Take it.

1278
01:47:19,250 --> 01:47:21,292
We haven't got to it.

1279
01:47:21,375 --> 01:47:24,125
<i>Paradise Lost,</i> Milton.

1280
01:47:24,208 --> 01:47:27,208
Man has questions for God.

1281
01:47:27,958 --> 01:47:30,333
Even God has questions.

1282
01:47:31,041 --> 01:47:35,750
I think he wanted answers
and that is why he sent us his son.

1283
01:47:36,333 --> 01:47:38,791
Death probably intrigued him.

1284
01:47:39,416 --> 01:47:40,416
Suffering.

1285
01:47:41,458 --> 01:47:44,416
I want to know who I am.

1286
01:47:45,166 --> 01:47:46,916
Where do I come from?

1287
01:47:47,458 --> 01:47:52,750
God took your memory just as I wish
he would take mine away.

1288
01:47:54,208 --> 01:47:57,500
Many years ago, I took a man's life.

1289
01:47:58,166 --> 01:47:59,166
A good man.

1290
01:47:59,625 --> 01:48:02,041
And I have been atoning for it since.

1291
01:48:04,333 --> 01:48:05,333
Forgive.

1292
01:48:06,125 --> 01:48:07,125
Forget.

1293
01:48:07,666 --> 01:48:09,583
The true measure of wisdom.

1294
01:48:10,791 --> 01:48:12,833
To know you have been harmed,

1295
01:48:12,916 --> 01:48:15,083
by whom you have been harmed,

1296
01:48:15,166 --> 01:48:18,125
and choose to let it all fade.

1297
01:48:19,208 --> 01:48:23,083
But I cannot forget
what I cannot remember.

1298
01:48:23,166 --> 01:48:24,666
Do you recall nothing?

1299
01:48:30,125 --> 01:48:32,750
In my dreams...

1300
01:48:35,625 --> 01:48:38,875
...I... see memories.

1301
01:48:42,208 --> 01:48:43,750
Different men.

1302
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:48,791
All... pieces.

1303
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I...

1304
01:48:59,333 --> 01:49:03,083
I remember f... fire and water.

1305
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:08,166
And sand under my feet.

1306
01:49:15,333 --> 01:49:16,583
And a word.

1307
01:49:19,250 --> 01:49:20,750
A single word.

1308
01:49:23,208 --> 01:49:24,500
What is it?

1309
01:49:27,291 --> 01:49:28,291
Victor.

1310
01:49:29,583 --> 01:49:30,750
<i>Go to it.</i>

1311
01:49:31,791 --> 01:49:32,916
<i>The word.</i>

1312
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:11,791
<i>And then I learned it.</i>

1313
01:50:12,708 --> 01:50:14,916
<i>The horror of the truth.</i>

1314
01:50:20,708 --> 01:50:23,875
<i>I understood that I was nothing.</i>

1315
01:50:25,166 --> 01:50:26,375
<i>A wretch.</i>

1316
01:50:27,083 --> 01:50:28,375
<i>A blot.</i>

1317
01:50:28,916 --> 01:50:32,041
<i>Not even of the same nature as man.</i>

1318
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:37,041
<i>This hurt clung to my mind.</i>

1319
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:41,375
<i>It never let go.</i>

1320
01:51:24,875 --> 01:51:26,458
<i>Then I saw it.</i>

1321
01:51:28,083 --> 01:51:29,458
<i>Your name.</i>

1322
01:51:30,208 --> 01:51:33,625
"Victor Frankenstein."

1323
01:51:33,708 --> 01:51:35,750
<i>And where to find you.</i>

1324
01:51:56,916 --> 01:51:58,250
No!

1325
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,250
No!

1326
01:53:10,291 --> 01:53:11,625
You came back.

1327
01:53:11,708 --> 01:53:14,083
I found what I am.

1328
01:53:18,291 --> 01:53:20,708
What I am made from.

1329
01:53:23,416 --> 01:53:28,041
I am... the child of a charnel house.

1330
01:53:31,333 --> 01:53:32,666
A wreckage.

1331
01:53:33,916 --> 01:53:37,208
Assembled from refuse
and the discarded dead.

1332
01:53:43,916 --> 01:53:45,125
A monster.

1333
01:53:46,708 --> 01:53:49,000
I know what you are.

1334
01:53:51,208 --> 01:53:52,333
A good man.

1335
01:53:53,208 --> 01:53:57,708
And... you are my friend.

1336
01:54:07,458 --> 01:54:08,625
Friend?

1337
01:54:10,583 --> 01:54:11,750
Friend.

1338
01:54:14,833 --> 01:54:16,042
What is that thing?

1339
01:54:17,791 --> 01:54:19,666
The... The thing from the woods?

1340
01:54:20,916 --> 01:54:22,208
What have you done to him?

1341
01:54:24,333 --> 01:54:25,333
Don't move.

1342
01:54:36,583 --> 01:54:38,833
Quick! Reload! Kill it!

1343
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,041
<i>There was silence again,</i>

1344
01:55:56,333 --> 01:56:01,375
<i>and then... merciless life.</i>

1345
01:56:16,875 --> 01:56:18,791
<i>How long did I die for?</i>

1346
01:56:19,375 --> 01:56:20,666
<i>I do not know.</i>

1347
01:56:21,375 --> 01:56:23,666
<i>But I saw my injuries healed.</i>

1348
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:28,375
<i>The cold winter air stung in my lungs.</i>

1349
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:39,625
<i>I felt lonelier than ever,</i>

1350
01:56:40,625 --> 01:56:45,458
<i>because for every man
there was but one remedy to all pain:</i>

1351
01:56:46,541 --> 01:56:51,166
<i>Death, a gift you too had denied me.</i>

1352
01:56:52,041 --> 01:56:54,166
<i>Envy rose within me</i>

1353
01:56:55,083 --> 01:56:58,083
and decided to demand
a single grace from you.

1354
01:56:59,333 --> 01:57:01,041
My creator.

1355
01:57:02,375 --> 01:57:06,833
I would demand... a companion.

1356
01:57:33,458 --> 01:57:35,125
I need you to get up.

1357
01:57:36,291 --> 01:57:37,750
Yes, of course. Of course.

1358
01:57:37,833 --> 01:57:40,708
The wedding will start soon
and I want you by my side.

1359
01:57:41,416 --> 01:57:42,708
It's hard to believe,

1360
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:45,750
if not for your kind nature.

1361
01:58:00,833 --> 01:58:03,208
I've spoken to a few guests
about the inquest.

1362
01:58:04,125 --> 01:58:05,208
About the explosion.

1363
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,166
The majority accept it for what it was.

1364
01:58:11,458 --> 01:58:13,458
And what was it, William?

1365
01:58:14,875 --> 01:58:15,958
The past, Victor.

1366
01:58:17,625 --> 01:58:19,333
A terrible accident.

1367
01:58:26,291 --> 01:58:28,083
I intend to sell the estate.

1368
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:33,541
All we have is each other.

1369
01:58:49,250 --> 01:58:51,083
I want you to throw the petals everywhere.

1370
01:58:51,166 --> 01:58:52,666
Throw them everywhere.

1371
01:58:53,666 --> 01:58:54,666
Mm.

1372
01:58:55,208 --> 01:58:57,083
Go upstairs and do some more of that.

1373
01:59:06,375 --> 01:59:09,833
I know it is bad luck
to see the bride before the ceremony.

1374
01:59:10,458 --> 01:59:11,750
Only for the groom.

1375
01:59:13,416 --> 01:59:15,000
Yes, that's right. Not for me.

1376
01:59:17,166 --> 01:59:18,375
Hello, Elizabeth.

1377
01:59:21,208 --> 01:59:24,791
I've rarely felt remorse
before and now I feel little else. I...

1378
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:29,583
A fever gripped me for so long,
but it has passed,

1379
01:59:29,666 --> 01:59:31,750
and I see you now as I should.

1380
01:59:33,458 --> 01:59:37,542
For whatever it's worth,
I... I wish you and my little brother,

1381
01:59:37,625 --> 01:59:40,416
who I love more than life, the very best.

1382
01:59:43,166 --> 01:59:45,125
You may like to believe you do.

1383
01:59:49,166 --> 01:59:51,041
And I dread to even hear it.

1384
01:59:55,208 --> 01:59:57,916
On my wedding day,
I ask you but for a single grace.

1385
01:59:59,166 --> 02:00:00,375
No more lies.

1386
02:00:01,791 --> 02:00:03,917
-I... I want to tell you...
-Leave my chambers now.

1387
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,875
-Elizabeth.
-Leave!

1388
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,875
Come out of the shadows,

1389
02:01:03,166 --> 02:01:04,458
if you are here.

1390
02:01:21,916 --> 02:01:23,166
Are you here to thank me?

1391
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:27,291
You survived and are intelligent enough
to have found me.

1392
02:01:29,291 --> 02:01:30,625
I made you well.

1393
02:01:30,708 --> 02:01:37,458
I need you to make a companion for me.

1394
02:01:38,166 --> 02:01:40,125
One like me.

1395
02:01:40,208 --> 02:01:42,416
A com... A companion?

1396
02:01:46,125 --> 02:01:47,125
Oh.

1397
02:01:48,041 --> 02:01:49,041
I see.

1398
02:01:53,333 --> 02:01:54,666
Another monster.

1399
02:01:55,333 --> 02:01:56,333
Yes.

1400
02:01:57,208 --> 02:01:59,375
We can be monsters together.

1401
02:02:02,583 --> 02:02:06,958
I have found sanity at such a cost,

1402
02:02:07,041 --> 02:02:11,417
and you here... are
madness calling me back.

1403
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:13,625
I cannot die.

1404
02:02:17,250 --> 02:02:19,291
And I cannot live...

1405
02:02:21,916 --> 02:02:22,916
alone.

1406
02:02:24,166 --> 02:02:26,708
In you I have created
something truly horrible.

1407
02:02:28,083 --> 02:02:29,958
Not something.

1408
02:02:30,875 --> 02:02:32,666
Someone.

1409
02:02:33,666 --> 02:02:36,833
You made someone.

1410
02:02:37,625 --> 02:02:38,625
Me.

1411
02:02:39,458 --> 02:02:42,250
Whatever puzzle I am, creator, I think.

1412
02:02:43,166 --> 02:02:44,416
I feel.

1413
02:02:45,875 --> 02:02:47,583
I have this sole petition...

1414
02:02:48,458 --> 02:02:52,541
Make one like me.

1415
02:02:54,291 --> 02:02:55,416
And then what?

1416
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,208
Procreation.

1417
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,625
Reproduction.

1418
02:03:02,583 --> 02:03:03,708
Mm...

1419
02:03:06,458 --> 02:03:07,625
A home?

1420
02:03:08,541 --> 02:03:09,958
A grave?

1421
02:03:11,541 --> 02:03:15,167
Death begetting death begetting death.

1422
02:03:15,250 --> 02:03:17,500
A race of devils
propagated upon the earth.

1423
02:03:17,583 --> 02:03:19,625
Obscenity perpetuating itself.

1424
02:03:20,416 --> 02:03:23,833
I am obscene to you,
but to myself I simply am.

1425
02:03:23,916 --> 02:03:25,166
Begone!

1426
02:03:27,625 --> 02:03:33,833
Never again will I make
something like you, wicked and deformed.

1427
02:03:38,291 --> 02:03:44,333
Then it is still
all about your will, Victor.

1428
02:03:45,083 --> 02:03:46,083
Hmm?

1429
02:03:47,083 --> 02:03:52,416
That horrible, horrible will
that birthed me condemns me now?

1430
02:03:53,708 --> 02:03:58,250
The miracle is not that I should speak,
but that you would ever listen!

1431
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:07,250
If you are not to award me love,
then I will indulge in rage.

1432
02:04:07,333 --> 02:04:08,875
And mine is infinite.

1433
02:04:15,208 --> 02:04:16,417
Step aside.

1434
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:17,500
Victor.

1435
02:04:18,875 --> 02:04:19,916
What's going on?

1436
02:04:38,666 --> 02:04:39,708
You...

1437
02:04:44,625 --> 02:04:45,625
You...

1438
02:04:46,666 --> 02:04:47,958
It's you.

1439
02:04:52,875 --> 02:04:55,000
Elizabeth, move away from it!

1440
02:04:55,708 --> 02:04:56,542
No!

1441
02:05:10,666 --> 02:05:13,417
It attacked her! It attacked her!

1442
02:05:33,291 --> 02:05:34,750
Take me with you.

1443
02:05:48,833 --> 02:05:50,583
Oh, my God!

1444
02:06:16,208 --> 02:06:18,417
No, let me... I can save you.

1445
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:19,666
I can save you.

1446
02:06:20,333 --> 02:06:21,333
From what?

1447
02:06:22,416 --> 02:06:23,541
From you?

1448
02:06:25,333 --> 02:06:26,625
I fear you, Victor.

1449
02:06:26,708 --> 02:06:27,833
No, no...

1450
02:06:27,916 --> 02:06:29,291
I always have.

1451
02:06:29,958 --> 02:06:32,416
Every ounce of madness and destruction.

1452
02:06:33,583 --> 02:06:37,166
The very conflagration
that devoured everything.

1453
02:06:39,083 --> 02:06:40,458
It all came from you.

1454
02:06:46,458 --> 02:06:48,291
You are the monster.

1455
02:07:21,041 --> 02:07:23,250
My place
was never in this world.

1456
02:07:25,125 --> 02:07:29,458
I sought and longed for something
I could not quite name.

1457
02:07:31,583 --> 02:07:33,458
But in you, I found it.

1458
02:07:36,750 --> 02:07:39,208
To be lost and to be found,

1459
02:07:40,208 --> 02:07:42,125
that is the lifespan of love.

1460
02:07:44,125 --> 02:07:45,625
And in its brevity,

1461
02:07:46,875 --> 02:07:48,125
its tragedy...

1462
02:07:52,208 --> 02:07:53,875
This has been made eternal.

1463
02:07:57,833 --> 02:08:00,875
Better this way... to fade...

1464
02:08:03,208 --> 02:08:05,166
With your eyes gazing upon me.

1465
02:08:48,208 --> 02:08:51,291
She is gone and I long to follow.

1466
02:08:56,125 --> 02:08:58,250
You gave me life unwanted.

1467
02:08:59,583 --> 02:09:01,416
I give that back to you.

1468
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:04,125
You thought me a monster.

1469
02:09:04,958 --> 02:09:06,500
Now I return the favor.

1470
02:09:12,375 --> 02:09:15,166
Kill me! Kill me now, do it!

1471
02:09:16,166 --> 02:09:18,166
I will make you bleed.

1472
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,125
I will make you humble.

1473
02:09:21,875 --> 02:09:23,541
You may be my creator,

1474
02:09:24,125 --> 02:09:27,625
but from this day forward,
I will be your master.

1475
02:10:08,041 --> 02:10:12,125
<i>You hunted me past the forests,</i>

1476
02:10:12,958 --> 02:10:14,833
<i>past the mountains,</i>

1477
02:10:15,541 --> 02:10:17,958
<i>past frozen horizons,</i>

1478
02:10:19,083 --> 02:10:22,000
<i>until there was nothing left.</i>

1479
02:10:22,583 --> 02:10:25,625
<i>Just you... and me.</i>

1480
02:10:45,875 --> 02:10:47,041
I need ammunition.

1481
02:10:50,291 --> 02:10:51,625
Sharpen this.

1482
02:10:51,708 --> 02:10:54,083
Three cans of condensed milk,
some firewood.

1483
02:10:56,041 --> 02:10:57,417
And six sticks of dynamite.

1484
02:10:57,500 --> 02:10:58,625
Six?

1485
02:10:59,375 --> 02:11:00,625
What are you hunting?

1486
02:11:02,250 --> 02:11:03,500
Big game.

1487
02:12:11,416 --> 02:12:13,458
No! No! No!

1488
02:12:22,333 --> 02:12:23,958
Victor.

1489
02:12:24,041 --> 02:12:26,500
You only listen when I hurt you.

1490
02:12:41,333 --> 02:12:44,792
This. You put your faith in this.

1491
02:12:44,875 --> 02:12:47,250
You think this will unmake me.

1492
02:12:49,208 --> 02:12:50,208
Hmm.

1493
02:12:51,708 --> 02:12:54,917
Light it then and hope it does,
but if it does not,

1494
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,166
I will come for you again.

1495
02:12:57,791 --> 02:12:59,125
Light it!

1496
02:13:06,708 --> 02:13:10,041
Now... run.

1497
02:13:47,125 --> 02:13:52,666
<i>So, there you were,
broken and discarded.</i>

1498
02:13:53,750 --> 02:13:55,125
<i>And I,</i>

1499
02:13:56,458 --> 02:13:58,250
<i>alive again.</i>

1500
02:14:02,958 --> 02:14:07,958
<i>I could feel my singed flesh regrowing.</i>

1501
02:14:08,791 --> 02:14:12,666
<i>The crackling of my bones resetting.</i>

1502
02:14:13,916 --> 02:14:20,250
<i>The murmur of my blood
pumping through my incessant heart.</i>

1503
02:14:21,375 --> 02:14:24,333
<i>And once more finding no mercy,</i>

1504
02:14:25,833 --> 02:14:28,291
<i>I had but one path.</i>

1505
02:14:40,458 --> 02:14:42,291
<i>And here we are.</i>

1506
02:14:44,625 --> 02:14:46,541
Spent and done.

1507
02:14:49,333 --> 02:14:52,666
No more in us to give or take.

1508
02:14:53,208 --> 02:14:54,625
The blood outside the tent...

1509
02:14:55,125 --> 02:14:56,166
It is mine.

1510
02:14:57,333 --> 02:14:58,791
All mine.

1511
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,291
I will bleed.

1512
02:15:02,833 --> 02:15:04,125
Ache.

1513
02:15:04,875 --> 02:15:06,000
Suffer.

1514
02:15:09,125 --> 02:15:11,958
You see, it will never end.

1515
02:15:31,916 --> 02:15:33,458
I am sorry.

1516
02:15:39,958 --> 02:15:42,000
Regret consumes me.

1517
02:15:44,125 --> 02:15:46,666
And I now regard my life for what it was.

1518
02:15:49,166 --> 02:15:51,583
You will go now, creator.

1519
02:15:54,416 --> 02:15:56,000
Fade away.

1520
02:15:58,708 --> 02:16:01,375
It will all be but a brief moment.

1521
02:16:02,291 --> 02:16:06,000
My birth. My grief.

1522
02:16:06,916 --> 02:16:08,375
Your loss.

1523
02:16:10,958 --> 02:16:13,208
I will not be punished.

1524
02:16:14,666 --> 02:16:16,416
Nor absolved.

1525
02:16:20,833 --> 02:16:22,166
What hope I had,

1526
02:16:23,208 --> 02:16:24,750
what rage...

1527
02:16:26,541 --> 02:16:27,916
It is all nothing.

1528
02:16:31,208 --> 02:16:35,666
The tide that brought me here
now comes to take you away.

1529
02:16:38,166 --> 02:16:39,500
Leaving me stranded.

1530
02:16:47,791 --> 02:16:49,250
Forgive me.

1531
02:16:51,250 --> 02:16:52,708
My son.

1532
02:17:00,666 --> 02:17:05,416
And if you have it in your heart,
forgive yourself into existence.

1533
02:17:06,041 --> 02:17:10,416
If death is not to be,
then consider this, my son.

1534
02:17:11,083 --> 02:17:12,791
While you are alive,

1535
02:17:13,666 --> 02:17:16,458
what recourse do you have but to live?

1536
02:17:23,875 --> 02:17:24,958
Live.

1537
02:17:26,625 --> 02:17:27,875
Say my name.

1538
02:17:29,708 --> 02:17:31,958
My father gave me that name,

1539
02:17:33,125 --> 02:17:34,416
and it meant nothing.

1540
02:17:36,958 --> 02:17:39,250
Now I ask you to give it back to me...

1541
02:17:41,750 --> 02:17:43,125
one last time.

1542
02:17:44,958 --> 02:17:46,708
The way you said it at the beginning.

1543
02:17:48,291 --> 02:17:50,583
When it meant the world to you.

1544
02:17:56,291 --> 02:17:57,500
Victor.

1545
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:02,000
I forgive you.

1546
02:18:25,083 --> 02:18:27,666
Rest now, Father.

1547
02:18:32,166 --> 02:18:33,541
Perhaps now,

1548
02:18:35,458 --> 02:18:37,541
we can both be human.

1549
02:18:47,250 --> 02:18:48,833
Weapons down.

1550
02:18:48,916 --> 02:18:51,041
-Put the weapons down!
-I am responsible for my men.

1551
02:18:52,458 --> 02:18:53,833
He can leave.

1552
02:20:28,666 --> 02:20:29,667
We are free!

1553
02:20:29,750 --> 02:20:31,000
We are free!

1554
02:20:32,625 --> 02:20:33,791
Captain...

1555
02:20:34,833 --> 02:20:36,125
What are your orders?

1556
02:20:36,208 --> 02:20:37,667
Man the sails.

1557
02:20:37,750 --> 02:20:38,708
Turn around.

1558
02:20:38,791 --> 02:20:40,250
Do you want to tell the men?

1559
02:20:40,833 --> 02:20:41,833
Men!

1560
02:20:43,041 --> 02:20:44,125
We're sailing home!

1561
02:20:44,833 --> 02:20:45,833
We're sailing home!
